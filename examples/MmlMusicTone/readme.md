# MML Music Tone example
This example demonstrates playing MML music using a callback function to call the Arduino tone() and noTone() functions.
To schedule playing the next tone/rest this example regularly calls the continuePlaying() method.
For an even simpler, asynchronous implementation using timer interrupts see the [MmlMusicPWM](https://github.com/maxint-rd/MmlMusicPWM) child library.
